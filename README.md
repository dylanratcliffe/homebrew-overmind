# Overmind Homebrew Tap

This repo contains Overmind's homebrew packages. PRs are generated from the [https://github.com/overmindtech/cli](https://github.com/overmindtech/cli) repo. Once PRs have had all tests pass, they should be labeled with `pr-pull` which will trigger a workflow that pulls the compiled bottles into the current release and closes the PR. Do not merge PRs directly.
